schools, supplementing chapter 36 of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes, and
repealing section 1 of P.L.2017, c.137.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "Law Against
Discrimination," P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) generally makes it unlawful
for schools to subject individuals to differential treatment based on race,
creed, color, national origin, ancestry, marital status, domestic partnership
or civil union status, sex, affectional or sexual orientation, gender identity
or expression, disability or nationality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Title IX of the
Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. s.1681) specifically prohibits
discrimination on the basis of sex in federally-funded education programs and activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 1 of P.L.2017,
c.137 (C.18A:36-41) directs the Commissioner of Education to establish
guidelines to provide direction for schools in addressing common issues
concerning the needs of transgender students, and to assist schools in
establishing policies and procedures that ensure a supportive and
nondiscriminatory environment for transgender students. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, this
guidance was prepared by the Department of Education after a review of policies
and guidance from other states and organizations, and in consultation with
educators, counselors, school psychologists, advocates, and parents. The
intended purpose of this guidance is to help school and district administrators
take steps to create an inclusive environment in which transgender and gender
nonconforming students feel safe and supported, and to ensure that each school
provides equal educational opportunities for all students, in compliance with
N.J.A.C.6A:7-1.1 et seq.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communication with the
student is paramount. Under the guidance established by the commissioner, schools
and school districts are encouraged to communicate openly, albeit confidentially,
with students regarding their transgender status or gender identity. Proper
communication with the student will ensure that appropriate steps are taken to
determine a student's preferences and address potential privacy concerns and
associated risks to the student's well-being.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is altogether
fitting and proper to protect transgender and gender nonconforming students by
establishing a requirement that school districts adopt policies and procedures
that proactively accept, recognize, and respect a student's asserted gender
identity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gender expression" means
external manifestations of gender, <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
expressed through a person's name, pronouns, clothing, haircut, behavior,
voice, or body characteristics. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gender identity" means a
person's internal, deeply held sense of gender.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gender nonconforming" means a
person whose gender expression does not conform to the gender expectations of
their family or community. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "LGBTQ" means lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, and queer or questioning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Transgender" means a person
whose gender identity or gender expression differs from those typically
associated with the sex and gender assigned at birth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Transition" means the process
by which a transgender person recognizes that their authentic gender identity
is not the same as the gender assigned at birth, and develops a more affirming
gender expression that feels authentic. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding any law,
rule, or regulation to the contrary, each school district in the State shall
adopt policies and procedures to implement the provisions of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp; A school district
shall accept, recognize, and respect a student's asserted gender identity
without requiring:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; parental consent; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp; any threshold diagnosis
or treatment requirements; or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp; a legal or court-ordered
name change.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There shall be no affirmative
duty for any school district personnel to notify a student's parent or guardian
of the student's gender identity or expression.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. In the event that a parent
or guardian of a minor student disagrees with the student regarding the name or
pronoun to be used at school and in the student's education records, a school
district shall consult its board attorney regarding the minor student's civil
rights and protections under the "Law Against Discrimination," P.L.1945, c.169
(C.10:5-1 et seq.). All school personnel and staff shall continue to refer to
the student in accordance with the student's chosen name and pronoun at school
and appropriate school personnel may consider providing resource information
regarding family counseling and support services outside of the school
district.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School districts shall anticipate
and be prepared for disputes between a minor student and the student's parents
and guardians concerning the student's gender identity or expression and shall
prominently display on their websites in easily accessible locations resources available
through advocacy groups and resources from the Department of Children and
Families and the Department of Education's &quot;Child Abuse, Neglect, and
Missing Children&quot; webpage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School district
personnel shall have an open, but confidential, discussion with the student to
ascertain the student's preference on matters such as chosen name, chosen
pronoun to use, and parental communications in order to ensure a safe and
supportive environment for transgender students. The purpose of the discussion
shall be to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; ensure that a
transgender student is addressed at school by the name and pronoun chosen by
the student, regardless of whether a legal name change or change in official
school records has occurred;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp; issue school
documentation for a transgender student, such as student identification cards,
in the name chosen by the student; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp; allow the transgender
student to dress in accordance with the student's gender identity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A school district shall
discuss with the student, and any other individuals at the student's request,
the risks associated with the student's transgender status being inadvertently
disclosed, including a discussion that the transgender status may be revealed
due to other students' discussions at home. The school district shall work with
the transgender student to ensure awareness of activities and events that may
inadvertently disclose the transgender student's status.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each school district
shall adopt policies and procedures to ensure that its schools provide a safe and
supportive learning environment that is free from discrimination and harassment
for transgender students, including students going through a gender transition.
School districts shall review and update their existing policies and
procedures, including those regarding classroom activities, school ceremonies,
school photographs, and dress codes, to verify that transgender students are
not excluded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To establish and
maintain a nondiscriminatory environment for all students, including transgender
and transitioning students, school districts shall: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; comply with section 3 of
P.L.2002, c.83 (C.18A:37-15) and N.J.A.C.6A:16-7.7, which prohibit harassment,
intimidation and bullying, and require that each district board of education develop,
adopt, and implement a policy prohibiting harassment, intimidation, or bullying
on school property, at a school-sponsored function or on a school bus. If
harassment based on gender identity creates a hostile environment, the school
shall take prompt and effective steps to end the harassment, prevent its
recurrence, and, as appropriate, remedy its effects;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp; provide staff training
on sensitivity and respect towards transgender students;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp; incorporate social and
emotional learning concepts into school culture and curricula;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp;&nbsp; seek a variety of
professionals, including school counselors and school psychologists, to provide
emotional supports for all students who demonstrate a need. School districts
shall ensure that school counselors and school psychologists are knowledgeable
regarding issues and concerns relevant to transgender students, students facing
other gender identity issues, or students who may be transitioning;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp;&nbsp; not enforce dress codes
more strictly for transgender and gender nonconforming students than for other
students; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6)&nbsp;&nbsp; honor and recognize a
student's asserted gender identity, and shall not require any documentation or
evidence in any form to support a student's asserted gender identity, including
diagnosis, treatment, or legal name change; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7)&nbsp;&nbsp; ensure nondiscrimination
on the basis of gender identity by providing transgender students equal access
to educational programs and activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; A school district
shall keep confidential a current, new, or prospective student's transgender
status. The district shall work with the student to create an appropriate
confidentiality plan regarding the student's transgender or transitioning
status. The student's birth name shall be kept confidential by school and district
staff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School district personnel
and staff shall not disclose any information that reveals a student's
transgender status except in instances related to a specific and compelling
need, including the health and safety of a student or an incident of
bias-related crime. In the event there exists a compelling need for disclosure,
the school district shall inform the student that the school intends to
disclose the student's transgender status for the student's protection and
well-being. Prior to disclosure, the student shall be given the opportunity to
personally disclose that information. School districts shall make every effort
to ensure that any disclosure is made in a way that reduces or eliminates the
risk of re-disclosure and protects the transgender student from further
harassment. Those measures may include the facilitation of counseling for the
student and the student's family to promote the family's acceptance and support
of the student's transgender status.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to
P.L.2002, c.83 (C.18A:37-13 et seq.), a school district is obligated to develop
a procedure to report, verbally and in writing, an act of harassment,
intimidation, or bullying committed by an adult or youth against a student. In
the event of such an investigation involving a transgender or transitioning
student, the school district shall inform the student of the district's
obligation to report the findings of the investigation, which permits the
parents or guardians of the students who are parties to the investigation to
receive information about the investigation in accordance with State and
federal law and regulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp; School district
officials shall take into account the circumstances of the incident, and the
status of an involved student as transgender or transitioning, when providing
notification to parents or guardians of all students involved in the reported
harassment, intimidation, or bullying incident and when conveying the nature of
the incident, including the actual or perceived protected category motivating
the alleged offense, pursuant to N.J.A.C.6A:16-7.7(a)2viii(2).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School districts shall
make a concerted effort to ensure that school officials obtain access to only
those education records in which they have legitimate educational interests. School
districts shall comply with all State and federal laws and regulations
regarding the confidentiality of student records and student privacy, including
the requirements set forth under the "Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
of 1974" (20 U.S.C. s.1232g).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; A school district
shall update student education records including, but not limited to,
attendance records, transcripts, and Individualized Education Programs, with
the student's chosen name and gender pronouns, consistent with the student's
gender identity and expression, and not circulate records with the student's
birth name, unless directed by the student. If a student has expressed a
preference to be called by a name other than their birth name, the school
district shall keep permanent student records containing the student's birth
name in a separate, confidential file. The file shall only be shared with
appropriate school staff after consultation with a student. A separate file
containing records bearing the student's chosen name may also be kept. If the
student has previously been known at school or in school records by a birth
name, the principal shall direct school personnel to use the student's chosen
name and not the student's birth name. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each school district
shall report to the Department of Education through the NJ SMART Resources and
Training website a student's name or gender based upon that student's chosen
name and corresponding gender identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a school district
changes a student's name or gender identity, it shall maintain locally a
separate record reflecting the student's legal name and sex assigned at birth
until receipt of documentation of a legal change of name or gender.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A school district shall
allow all students to participate in any gender-segregated classes or athletic
activities, including intramural and interscholastic athletics, in a manner
consistent with their gender identity. The district shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provide transgender
students with the same opportunities to participate in physical education as
other students in accordance with their gender identity;</p>

student to participate in gender-segregated school activities in accordance
with the student's gender identity;</p>

formation of student clubs or programs regarding issues related to LGBTQ youth;

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; A school district
shall ensure that all students have access to restrooms, locker rooms, and
changing facilities in accordance with their gender identity to allow for
involvement in various school programs and activities. The school principal
shall work with the student and staff to ensure that all parties are aware of
facility policies and understand that the student may access the restroom,
locker room, and changing facility that corresponds to the student's gender
identity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A school district shall
ensure that a student who reports to the district that the student is
uncomfortable using a sex-segregated restroom are provided with a safe and
adequate alternative, including a single, unisex restroom or the nurse's
restroom. &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This bill codifies into law
the guidelines issued by the Department of Education concerning the needs of
transgender students. Current law directs the Commissioner of Education to
establish guidelines to provide direction for public schools in addressing
common issues concerning the needs of transgender students, and to assist
schools in establishing policies and procedures that ensure a supportive and
nondiscriminatory environment for transgender students. Because this bill
codifies those guidelines into law, this bill also repeals the section of
current law requiring the commissioner to establish the guidelines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guidelines were prepared
by the department after a review of policies and guidance from other states and
organizations, and in consultation with educators, counselors, school
psychologists, advocates, and parents. The intended purpose of these guidelines
is to help school and district administrators take steps to create an inclusive
environment in which transgender and gender nonconforming students feel safe
and supported, and to ensure that each public school provides equal educational
opportunities for all students, in compliance with N.J.A.C.6A:7-1.1 et seq.</p>
